-- This performs a _partial slide_. This means that we slide everything using right sliding,

-- This is necessary for solving programs written like:
-- ... >>> second ((pre v *** id) >>> (f *** pre v))
-- which would be solved by sliding only the f to the other side, i.e.:
-- second (first f) >>> ... >>> second (pre (v,v))
-- To do this, we split the term we are about to slide (currR) into a part to slide (slide)
-- and a part to not slide (noslide), and assemble the new Loop accordingly.
